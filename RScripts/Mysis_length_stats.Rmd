This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("~/Dropbox/Mysis metapopulations")

mysis_dat <- read.csv("CopyofMysisIDs.csv")

#data filter
no.gravid <- subset(mysis_dat, Fecund.Fem..Y.N. == "N")
no.gravid <- subset(no.gravid, Habitat != "")
  no.gravid <- droplevels(no.gravid)
no.gravid <- subset(no.gravid, ID >= 105)
#make length numeric
no.gravid$Length..mm.2 <- as.numeric(as.character(no.gravid$Length..mm.))

len.ng <- lm(Length..mm.2 ~ Habitat, data = no.gravid)
  anova(len.ng)
  plot(Length..mm.2 ~ Habitat, data = no.gravid)
    P <- no.gravid[no.gravid$Habitat == "Pelagic",]
      mean(P$Length..mm.2)
    B <- no.gravid[no.gravid$Habitat == "Benthic",]
      mean(P$Length..mm.2)

#conclusion : yes, lengths are significantly different when Gravid females are removed, however, the averages are essentially equil. plot shows lengths looking largely the same.
